## Projects
**M.S thesis**
- An explainable model for predicting porosity in _freeze-casting_.

**Ensemble models to forecast production in an oil reservoir**
- [Publication](https://doi.org/10.48072/2525-7579.rog.2022.036), presented at the Rio Oil and Gas congress.
- Here I used python, unittests and optimization algorithms to search for the global minima of a selected loss function.

**Project Leader in Apuama Racing**
- FSAE team
- Simulated vehicle dynamics for the suspension design.
- Program to calculate force distribution for a given tire input force.
